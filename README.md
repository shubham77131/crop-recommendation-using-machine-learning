# crop-recommendation-using-machine-learning
Ensemble model for the recommendation of crops.

# Project overview
The primary goal of this project is to assist farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to cultivate. By inputting environmental and soil conditions, the models predict the most suitable crop type, thereby optimizing yield and resource utilization.
This project implements machine learning models to recommend suitable crops to farmers based on soil nutrient data (Nitrogen,Phosphorus, Potassium), pH value, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The system utilizes both Decision Tree and XGBoost algorithms for classification.
The data used for training the models was sourced from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle: Crop Recommendation Dataset.

# Data sorces
the primary sorce of data for this project is from kaggle.
